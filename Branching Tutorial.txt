Branching process:
git pull origin master //Pull any updates, and ensure you are on the master branch
git checkout -b branchName //Creates a local branch to work on your work
git push origin HEAD(or branchName) //Create the branch in the global repository
//Do your work for the feature
//Push all work to origin HEAD(or branchName)
//Once work is done follow the following steps
//Perform final push
git checkout master
git merge branchName //branchName is the name of the branch you were working on. This creates an optional pull request
//Go to github and and create the pull request
//Check for the green checkmark, "Ready to merge"
//If any merge conflicts we can go through together
//After all merge conflicts are resolved, accept PR
git branch -d branchName
